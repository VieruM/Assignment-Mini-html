                        <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on
                            the pioneering
                            work
                            of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent
                            by some seven
                            years.
                            The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by
                            American
                            Telephone &
                            Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little
                            use of it, as
                            they
                            already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point
                            been challenging
                            Pupin
                            with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which
                            was immensely
                            valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and
                            especially submarine
                            ones.</p>
